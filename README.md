SnowGlobe.framework
===================
SnowGlobe.framework its easy to use, open source iOS framework written in swift. It allows you to ad delightful / cheesy Christmas easter egg to your awesome app for holiday season. When user shakes the device, your app “turns into a snow globe”. Leveraging [CAEmitterLayer](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/Documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CAEmitterLayer_class/index.html) to create snow fall, snow globe like animation while device is shaken. I am a sucker for that kinda of thing. I don’t see anything wrong with falling for spirit of the holiday season and getting bit cheesy.

###How to build and run sample project
Download source form repo. To build and run it on device open Sample.xcworkspace. This workspace contains three projects. SnowGlobe framework project, Swift and Objective-C sample projects. Select either SwiftSample or ObjCSample schema. You’ll have to set up code signing to run on the device. Select either Swift/ObjCSample target and choose your team. Sample app demonstrates three ways you can use SnowGlobeView. My original use case was to ad SnowGlobeView as subview of application’s keyWindow. That way when user shakes the device, snow layer is over any ViewController’s view. For more detail check out about implementation section.
