SnowGlobe.framework
===================
SnowGlobe.framework its easy to use, open source iOS framework written in swift. It allows you to ad delightful / cheesy Christmas easter egg to your awesome app for holiday season. When user shakes the device, your app “turns into a snow globe”. Leveraging [CAEmitterLayer](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/Documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CAEmitterLayer_class/index.html) to create snow fall, snow globe like animation while device is shaken. I am a sucker for that kinda of thing. I don’t see anything wrong with falling for spirit of the holiday season and getting bit cheesy.
